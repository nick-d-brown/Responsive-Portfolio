                If you are reading this, then you are either a recruiter/company looking for a new addition to your team, or you are an incredibly
                lost internet traveler. In the case of the later you may want to see you self to the "go back" button as
                this website merely showcases some of my work and a how to contact me, though you are welcome to stay and
                explore! In the case of the former, welcome to my portfolio website.

                My name is Nick Brown. I am currently living in Salt Lake City, Utah. I am an avid outdoorsman and can often be found on
                a bike, paddleboard, or mountainside exploreing the outdoors. When I am not spending time outside I am inside
                most likely reading, writing, or editing code. Around a year ago I found myself looking for a new challenge
                in life and was met by the complex world of code. Since then I have spent my time absorbing as much information
                as possible from every source I can find.
            </p>
            <p>
                My technical coding skills include experience in: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and soon to be many more languages. As for my
                other professional skills, I have spent the majority of my professional career at the retail cooperative
                REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.). In that time, I worked my way up from customer service, to sales, then
                into the shop as a tech level 1, then onto the dock working in order fulfillment, and finally as the operations
                sales lead. While working as an operations lead, I helped oversee shipping and receiving and inventory management.
                As a team leader at the store it was my job to help guide employees working under the operations umbrella
                in addition to running our semi-annual store inventory periods and large used gear sales.
